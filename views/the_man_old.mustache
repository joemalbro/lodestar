					THEN
In the long tradition of excellence reminiscent of Tiffany mosaics, Stewart Ritwo, president of LODESTAR, Statements in Stone, considers himself the torch bearer of the Old Masters. "My mission and passion in life is to create distinctive statements in stone using all of the world's natural resources which will become the heirlooms of the future."

LODESTAR is the top specialist in the field of custom stonework and ornamental stone inlay, also known as pietre dure. Combining the time-honored art of  Florentine mosaic with modern technology, LODESTAR works closely with designers and architects to create luxe decorative surfaces for floors, walls, tables, and vanities from its palette of more than 150 semi-precious and naturally hard stones.

The company was conceived, developed and founded by Mr. Ritwo after an extensive global search brought him into contact with Egyptian expatriates who were refining their craft of cutting, polishing and engraving colored gemstones with H. Stern jewelers in Brazil. They went on to develop the proprietary machinery for cutting and polishing the stones that are now used in the LODESTAR projects.

In their workshops in Europe, Asia, South America, and the U.S., the artisans at LODESTAR, in business since 1986, employ techniques that incorporate hand-cut and hand-set semi-precious and natural hard stones in unique designs. Stock mosaic designs range from ornate, traditional florals to stylized art nouveau and art deco treatments and clean restrained geometrics.

In addition to stock items, designers and architects can create and specify original custom designs to be translated into stone mosaic on any surface imaginable, using such stones as malachite, sodalite, serpentinite, and onyx in a wide variety of color and styles, from Italianate to high-tech geometrics, from private residences to corporate logos for such high-identity areas as reception room walls ands floors and conference rooms.

Creating memories <br> in stone, capturing the precious moments of your life from the cradle to the grave,  is a time honored practice <br>that MrLodeStar believes adds richness to a family by creating a legacy in stone. <br><br>

ECONOMIC AND STRUCTURAL FACTORS
Until very recently mosaic was a costly art. It always required patrons -- royalty, aristocracy, the Church -- rich enough to obtain from this impressive and majestic medium utmost splendor for their power, status and wealth by having buildings and furniture lavishly jeweled in this expensive manner. Under the almost exclusive influence of this class of clients who actually made up "the Establishment," mosaic traditionally inclined toward consolidation and conservatism in choice of subject as well as in style. Consequently, throughout the various vicissitudes of history, we find mosaic following rather than leading the other arts in experiment, exploration and stylistic evolutions. However, Florentine mosaic is made up of suitably shaped pieces of colored stones that are closely fitted together to form a pattern or a picture, and as such it has in fact potential affinities with modern styles. It calls for simplification and stylization, it promotes striking effects and a heightening of reality, it tends toward expressionistic vigor and abstract shapes -- the ancient art of mosaic can be one of the most contemporary indeed.


					The Wall Street Journal called him "The Michelangelo of Mosaic". <br>

					Pietre dure techniques were revived and advanced in Rome during the sixteenth century, and the antique mosaics unearthed during archaeological excavations of the era were a rich source for the polychrome marbles that were admired for both their beauty and ancient heritage. Pietre dure emerged as a refined art form, and during the seventeenth century the technique moved to the forefront of European decorative arts under the patronage of the Florentine Medici family. In 1588, Ferdinando I de’ Medici established the grand ducal manufacturer of works, Galleria dei Lavori, which was renamed the Opificio delle Pietre Dure during the mid-1800s and is still active in Florence. Generations of the Medici family patronized the Galleria dei Lavori, which was a fervent center of production employing an amalgamation of artists, goldsmiths, jewelers, cabinetmakers, ebonists, and bronze casters, who labored together to produce elaborate creations for the grand ducal family. The artisans crafted remarkable pieces of pietre dure that garnered praise not only within the ranks of the Galleria dei Lavori and Italy, but also on an international level. While the baroque painter combined rich oil paints to create sometimes-impermanent images on the canvas, the pietre dure artist looked to the abundant palette of semiprecious stones to laboriously create a virtually permanent image.

Created in the grand ducal workshops during the third quarter of the seventeenth century, this pietre dure cabinet in the Gilbert collection features nineteen panels with birds and flowers, some so realistically rendered as to be an identifiable species. Pietre dure artists also looked to the façades and interiors of grand Baroque architecture as an earthly reality that could be converted into a microcosm of architectural artifice worthy of marvel. The distinctly architectural form of the cabinet features a central door flanked by two pilasters of brocatelle marble with gilt bronze Ionic capitals and bases that crown a triangular pediment and gilt bronze balustrade with figures representing the four seasons. Daniel Finch (1647–1730), the second earl of Winchelsea and Nottingham, was thought to have purchased the cabinet while on a Grand Tour from 1665 to 1668. This extended journey through the ancient and modern sites of continental Europe was considered essential to a cultured man’s education. Often, cabinets like this one were shipped from Italy to England, where the owner would have a stand constructed for its display. The nineteenth-century ebonized stand of this cabinet incorporates Dutch-style naturalistic marquetry of exotic woods and ivory. With its many locking drawers and compartments, the cabinet and its stand were made to house valuable personal possessions.
