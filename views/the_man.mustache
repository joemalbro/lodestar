					<h1>Mr<span style="color:red;">Lodestar</span></h1>
					<h2>The Modern Day Michaelangelo</h2>
					<p style="font-size:14px;color:white;">
					Mr. LodeStar is leading the trend from entrepreneur to socialpreneur using the time honored tradition of artisan created mosaics to tell your distinctive story in stone, the LodeStar Experience.<br><br>

					The Lodestar ,in astronomy , is the the star that shows the way. It was historically used by sailors to guide the course. LodeStar , Statements in Stone, is leading the way and guiding the course to your personal distinctive experience.<br> <br>

					Emerging into a culture imbedded in disconnect, information overload and depersonalized experiences, LodeStar introduces the concept of self-reflection to personalize the experience of gifting.<br> <br>

					Symbolism is a fundamental expression of self. Signs and symbols give meaning to the possibilities of reflection and offer powerful possibilities for communication. Symbols reveal aspects of the self which escape other modes of expression. They are a dynamic form of dreams and vision.<br><br>

					The symbol is a guide to your inner self and when crafted into a mosaic is a timeless tool to express your feelings for your own edification and as a calling card, a gifting of love to others.<br><br> 

					History is replete with the telling of the story of humanity, the development of cultures using mosaic. Creating memories in stone, capturing the precious moments of your life from the cradle to the grave,  is a time honored practice that MrLodeStar believes adds richness to a family by creating a legacy in stone.<br><br>

					"It's all about the story", MrLodeStar says. He is passionate about providing people with a vehicle to express themselves, to explore their uniqueness by making a mosaic. "My passion is to shed light and to assist men and women to better understand themselves through the process of making a mosaic. The symbols are living and ever expanding. The idea propagates and lives on for future generations . It's a living  legacy. "<br><br>

					The art of Florentine mosaic is called PIETRE DURE, Latin meaning hard stones.  It is a decorative art using precious and semi- precious stones to literally make a painting in stone. Pietra dura is a laborious hand made process that produces a very valuable product. Pietra dura became quite well known during the Medici era. The aristocracy, Kings and Popes were patrons of the arts who commissioned works in this medium to tell the story of their lives, wives, conquests, battles won , alliances forged and to memorialize family births, celebrations and deaths. These works of art were given as symbols of love, marriage, and in thanksgiving for favors.<br><br>

					The Wall Street Journal online called him The Michelangelo of Mosaic. <br><br>
					Ever the iconoclast , indeed , like Michelangelo , MrLodeStar sees the angel in the marble and seeks to set it free. By democratizing the decorative art to be accessible and affordable to everyone, he is spearheading the Age of Enlightened Experience through the making of your own distinctive Statement in Stone.<br><br>

					"I love the idea of sharing feelings and emotions. I love to encourage, inspire, empower people to express themselves, to grow as a person and to share their story. You deserve to be powerful, you deserve to be heard, you deserve to express yourself . I would love to offer this medium as a way for people to put down their phone and focus on what is meaningful. When you are giving a gift to someone, make it meaningful . It is the flow, the process that you can attach to that gives you hope and contentment and a sense of well being from making the piece. The only thing besides making good food and making good love is making a good mosaic. "<br><br> 

					The Lodestar Experience offers several ways in which you can accomplish this using stone as your blank canvas. The luxury experience is now available to all from the small art discs symbolic of your company, achievements , family events to decorative home arts and commercial applications. "Create life's memories in a mosaic timeline. Capture your moment, upload the design and we make your memory in stone."<br><br>

					MrLodeStar, a longtime patron of the arts, has served the interests of the wealthy by assisting them in making their own statements in stone,  now brings the experience to everyone. <br><br>

					MrLodeStar has been a socialpreneur for decades carefully cultivating relationships with artisans in countries where the craft has been in their families for generations. "They are so passionate and they take pride in their work because it is their purpose in life according to the system they were born into."  He will now extend his commitment to social consciousness by supporting orphanages from these communities.<br><br>

					MrLodeStar is a self-made entrepreneur, socialpreneur , patron of the arts and modern Medici man whose greatest gift is to commission everyone to be their own artist, to be free to create your own Statement in Stone. A timeless gift of love that will last forever.<br><br>

					Let MrLodeStar guide you on YOUR way! <br><br>
